**Text Summarization Tool (NLP)**:

      📝 Text Summarization Tool (NLP)
      
      A Python-based Text Summarization tool that supports both **Extractive** and **Abstractive** summarization techniques using **NLTK** and **BERT Transformers**.
       
      🚀 Features
      - Extractive Summarization using NLTK (selects the most important sentences from the text)
      - Abstractive Summarization using BERT (generates new sentences capturing the meaning)
      - Easy-to-use command-line interface
      - Works with any text input

## 📌 Example Output

**Input:**

> Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to understand and process human language. It powers applications like chatbots, translators, and sentiment analysis.

**Extractive Summary:**

> NLP is a field of AI that enables machines to understand human language.

**Abstractive Summary:**

> NLP allows computers to comprehend and interpret human language for various applications.

## 📜 Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* NLTK
* Transformers (HuggingFace)
* PyTorch / TensorFlow (for BERT)
